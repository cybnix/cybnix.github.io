## What is bWAPP

So, bWAPP (Buggy Web Application) is an intentionally vulnerable web application that developers, security professionals, students and basically everyone can use to practice and enhance their web security skills. It has a big range of security vulnerabilities and challenges, allowing users to explore and understand common web application security issues in a safe and controlled environment. I have been using it for some time now and I really love how much stuff you can practice with it.

Bee-box is just a custom linux VM which comes with bWAPP installed on it. It is extremely easy to set up one for yourself so you can play around with it. If you wish to get it, click here : [!button size="s" corners="pill" variant="warning" text="Bee-box"](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bwapp/files/bee-box/)

- :icon-question: Setting it up
    - :icon-check-circle: Download **bee-box** from the button above (.7z archive).
    - :icon-check-circle: Extract it.
    - :icon-check-circle: Load the .vmx file with your VMware Workstation (did you know that VMware Workstation Pro is now free for personal use?) [!button size="s" corners="pill" variant="contrast" text="Click me"](https://blogs.vmware.com/workstation/2024/05/vmware-workstation-pro-now-available-free-for-personal-use.html) 
    - :icon-check-circle: Start it.

    - :icon-check-circle: That's all! Now you have a vulnerable VM which you can freely break üòÅ.

In my future posts, I plan on executing a few simple attacks on a bee-box VM. Stay tuned if you're interested! üëÄ
